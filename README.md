# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

# Layer3 — Restaurant Portfolio Website (Jaffna, Sri Lanka)

Modern, mobile-responsive portfolio site for **Layer3** — an Indian • Sri Lankan • Chinese dine-in restaurant in **Jaffna, Sri Lanka**.

Tech stack:
Build/preview:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Assets (logo + placeholders)

- Logo used by the site: `src/assets/logo.jpg`
	- Replace this file with the provided logo at `/mnt/data/Image (1).jpg`.
	- Keep the filename as `logo.jpg` so imports remain unchanged.

- Hero background: `src/assets/hero.jpg`
- Gallery placeholders: `src/assets/gallery/*.jpg`

All images are currently local placeholders and are easy to swap later.

## Pages

- Home: `/`
- About: `/about`
- Menu Highlights (display only): `/highlights`
- Gallery (with lightbox dialog): `/gallery`
- Events & Catering: `/events`
